In NestJS, a module is a fundamental building block and organizational unit of an application.
Modules are used to group related components, such as controllers, services, and other providers, into cohesive and self-contained units.
Modules help in organizing and structuring your application, making it more maintainable, scalable, and easier to manage.

Everything in nestjs is a kind of module.

The @Module() decorator takes a single object whose properties describe the module:

providers:	the providers that will be instantiated by the Nest injector and that may be shared at least across this module

controllers:	the set of controllers defined in this module which have to be instantiated

imports:	These imported modules export providers that are required within the current module.
          By specifying the imports property in your module decorator and including a list of imported modules,
           you are telling NestJS that you want to use the providers exported by those imported modules in your current module.

exports:	the subset of providers that are provided by this module and should be available in other modules which import this module. 
            You can use either the provider itself or just its token (provide value)

what are controllers and services in module?
****************************************************

In a NestJS module, controllers and services are two fundamental components that work together 
to handle HTTP requests, process business logic, and respond to client requests.
They play distinct roles in the application's architecture:

1) Controllers:

Responsibility: Controllers are responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests, processing them, and returning HTTP responses. They act as request handlers.

Usage: Controllers define endpoints (routes) and their corresponding request methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). 
Each endpoint in a controller is responsible for a specific operation or resource.

Example: Here's a simple example of a controller that handles CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for a "cats" resource:

import { Controller, Get, Post, Put, Delete } from '@nestjs/common';
import { CatsService } from './cats.service';

@Controller('cats')
export class CatsController {
  constructor(private readonly catsService: CatsService) {}

  @Get()
  findAll() {
    return this.catsService.findAll();
  }

  @Post()
  create(cat: CatDto) {
    return this.catsService.create(cat);
  }

  @Put(':id')
  update(@Param('id') id: string, @Body() cat: CatDto) {
    return this.catsService.update(id, cat);
  }

  @Delete(':id')
  remove(@Param('id') id: string) {
    return this.catsService.remove(id);
  }
}

2) Services:

Responsibility: Services encapsulate the application's business logic, data manipulation, and interactions with databases or external services. 
They abstract the functionality that controllers need to perform their tasks.

Usage: Services are typically injected into controllers (or other services) and used to perform specific operations. They provide a clean and reusable way to manage application logic.

Example: Here's a simple example of a service that manages the "cats" data:

import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class CatsService {
  private readonly cats: Cat[] = [];

  findAll(): Cat[] {
    return this.cats;
  }

  create(cat: Cat): void {
    this.cats.push(cat);
  }

  update(id: string, cat: Cat): Cat | undefined {
    const index = this.cats.findIndex((c) => c.id === id);
    if (index !== -1) {
      this.cats[index] = cat;
      return cat;
    }
    return undefined;
  }

  remove(id: string): void {
    const index = this.cats.findIndex((c) => c.id === id);
    if (index !== -1) {
      this.cats.splice(index, 1);
    }
  }
}


****************************************************
what are imports in the nest js modules
****************************************************

In NestJS, import statements within modules are used to bring in external dependencies, other modules, or providers (services, controllers, etc.) to be used within the module. Imports allow you to declare the dependencies and wiring between different parts of your application.

Here's a breakdown of the different types of imports you can use in NestJS modules:

1) External Dependencies: 
You can import external libraries, modules, or classes into your NestJS module to use their functionality. For example:

import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { TypeOrmModule } from '@nestjs/typeorm';
import { UserController } from './user.controller';

@Module({
  imports: [TypeOrmModule.forRoot(), TypeOrmModule.forFeature([User])],
  controllers: [UserController],
})
export class UserModule {}

In this example, the TypeOrmModule is an external dependency that is imported to enable database integration within the UserModule.

***********************

2) Other Modules: You can import other NestJS modules into your current module to reuse their components (controllers, services, etc.) or to organize your application into feature modules.
 This is a common practice for building modular and maintainable applications:


import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { UserModule } from './user/user.module';
import { AuthModule } from './auth/auth.module';

@Module({
  imports: [UserModule, AuthModule],
})
export class AppModule {}

In this example, the AppModule imports the UserModule and AuthModule to combine their functionality.

***********************

3) Providers and Services: You can import providers and services from other modules or external dependencies to use them within your current module. For example:

import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { UserService } from './user.service';

@Module({
  providers: [UserService],
})
export class UserModule {}

In this example, the UserService is imported into the UserModule and registered as a provider.

***********************

4) Configuration: You can import configuration values or modules responsible for configuration management into your modules to access environment-specific settings or constants.

import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { ConfigModule } from '@nestjs/config';

@Module({
  imports: [ConfigModule.forRoot()],
})
export class AppModule {}

Here, the ConfigModule is imported to allow the application to access configuration settings.

********************************************************************************************************

The properties of the @Module() decorator in NestJS are used to configure and define the behavior of the module. 
Here's an explanation of each property and its purpose:

providers:
Purpose: The providers property is an array that specifies the providers (services, factories, or other injectable objects) that will be instantiated by the Nest injector within the current module.
Use: These providers are available for injection into controllers, other providers, or any other component that depends on them within the same module.
Example: You define and list services, repositories, or other injectable classes here that are specific to this module.

***************************************************

controllers:
Purpose: The controllers property is an array that lists the controller classes defined in the current module.
Use: Controllers handle incoming HTTP requests and define the request handling logic for routes. When you specify controllers in a module, they are instantiated and can be accessed via the routes defined in your application.
Example: You include controller classes that should be associated with this module.

***************************************************

imports:
Purpose: The imports property is an array of other modules that you want to import into the current module. These imported modules can export providers and other resources.
Use: Importing modules allows you to access the providers and functionality from those modules within the current module. It helps organize and share dependencies across different parts of your application.
Example: You include imported modules that provide resources required by the components in the current module, such as services or configuration.

***************************************************

exports:
Purpose: The exports property is an array of providers or provider tokens that should be made available for other modules that import the current module. You can expose specific providers or their tokens to other modules.
Use: This property is particularly useful when you want to share certain providers or functionality from the current module with other parts of your application. Exported providers can be injected into other modules.
Example: You list providers that you want to make accessible to other modules when they import the current module. This can be handy for creating reusable libraries or sharing common services.

***************************************************

In summary, these properties in the @Module() decorator help you organize and configure your NestJS application by defining the providers, controllers, imported modules, and exported resources for a particular module. 
This modular approach allows you to build scalable and maintainable applications with well-defined boundaries between different parts of your code.
