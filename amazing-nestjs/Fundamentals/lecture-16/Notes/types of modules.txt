In NestJS, modules are a fundamental organizational unit used to structure and manage an application. 

There are several types of modules in NestJS:

Feature Modules: 
These are the most common type of modules in NestJS. 
They encapsulate a specific feature or domain of your application. 
Feature modules typically contain controllers, services, and other related components.
 They help keep your codebase organized and maintainable by grouping related functionality together.

****************************

Core Module: 
The core module contains essential, application-wide functionality and services that are used throughout the entire application.
 It often includes providers for services that should have a single instance shared across the entire application, such as authentication and logging services.

****************************

Shared Module:
The module which we import in another module is called shared module.
The shared module contains code that can be reused across multiple feature modules. 
This includes common components, pipes, and utilities that are shared among different parts of the application. 
Shared modules help promote code reusability.

Example;
suppose we can import users module in employees module, 
now we can use all the classes in employees-module that the user module exports.
Note: If we use any other provider of UsersModule(in employees module) that it do not exports  , it cause error.

@Module({
  ...
  imports: [UsersModule],
  ...
})


****************************

Global Module: 
Global modules are used to import and configure third-party libraries or modules that need to be available throughout the application, regardless of the feature modules.
These modules are typically imported in the root module (AppModule) and can provide global configuration settings.

@Global()
@Module({
  exports: [UserService]
})

Now there is no need to import that UsersModule in any module, we can use UsersModule anywhere in our application,
Now we can directly use classes that UsersModule module exports(UserService) without importing the UsersModule.

We still need to import this module in our root module (app.module.ts)

****************************

Dynamic Modules: Dynamic modules are created at runtime and are useful for scenarios where you need to configure a module based on dynamic data or conditions. They are defined using the register method of the Module class and can be used to load modules dynamically.

****************************

Testing Module: This is not a specific module type but a concept in NestJS for creating modules specifically for testing purposes. Testing modules help you isolate and mock dependencies when writing unit tests for your application.

****************************

Understanding and properly organizing modules in your NestJS application is crucial for maintaining a clean and scalable codebase. Each module type serves a specific purpose in structuring and managing the application's functionality.
