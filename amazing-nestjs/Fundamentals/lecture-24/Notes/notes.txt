Till now we are validating the simple form of data such as primitive values coming in the request. 

But to validate the objects, nested objects, or complex forms of data we can use the JOI package to validate against a schema, and this technique is called Schema-based validation. 

In this video, we will learn Schema-based validation by creating a custom validation pipe.

Video steps:

1) create DTO (just the body data type in this case)

2)
npm install joi --save

3) create schema (contain contraints and validations)

Note: joi only do validation, ( not do transformation)
